    <h3>THE SEVEN REASONS WHY YOU SHOULD BE A JUVENTUS FAN</h3>
    <ol>
        <h4>
            <li>Tradition</li>
        </h4>
        <ul><i>-Born in 1897, Juventus is the third oldest club in Italy, after Genoa (1893) and Udinese (1896), and at
                the end of the 2014-15 season, has won 33 Scudetti, the most in Italy. In second place is Milan, with 18
                Scudetti, so Juve is by far the most successful club domestically.

                Juventus has also been in the hands of the Agnelli family since 1923 when FIAT owner Edoardo Agnelli
                bought the club. His sons Gianni, affectionaly known as L'Avvocato, and Umberto became presidents in the
                1950s and 1960s and now Umberto's son, Andrea, is the club's president. It makes the family the longest
                lasting ownership in any sports franchise globally.

                Every start of the season, the first team plays the primavera team in Villar Perosa, a village in
                southwest of Turin where Edoardo had a stadium built, where the players bring their family with them for
                the friendly match.

                There's one interesting story I always remember. Milos Krasic, our newest signing in 2010, missed his
                flight and as the result, would've missed this annual friendly match. He then chartered a private jet
                out of his own pocket to make sure he could arrive in time and play.</i></ul>
        <h4>
            <li>"Fino alla fine"</li>
        </h4>
        <ul><i>"Fino alla fine," or "until the end" in English, describes Juve well. The fantasisti make us dream, but
                grinta, the passion and fighting spirit until the game ends, makes Juve tick.

                Why do Juve fight until the end? Giampiero Boniperti, one of Juve's legends, said it best, "Vincere non
                è importante, è l'unica cosa che conta" or "winning is not important; It's the only thing that matters."

                One of the perfect examples is Juventus vs. Fiorentina in the 1994-95 season. Back then, Fiorentina had
                a superb trident — Gabriel Batistuta and Francesco Baiano supported by Rui Costa. They shocked Juventus
                by leading two goals to nil when the first half ended. Juve were down, but not out, and in the last 27
                minutes, captain Gianluca Vialli led a comeback with two goals in three minutes. Three minutes from
                time, Juventus scored the game-winning goal.

                Fino alla fine.

                And who scored the winning goal?</i></ul>
        <h4>
            <li>It's a cool name</li>
        </h4>
        <ul><i>To me, "Juventus" sounds cool. I'm not Italian, so I do not relate to city names like Milan, Roma, Genoa
                or others.

                I grew up watching Marco van Basten, Ruud Gullit, and Frank Rijkaard dominate Serie A, the best league
                at that moment, and the world of football in the 1990s but while my friends flocked to the rossoneri, I
                was not only attracted to them at all. I loved how they played, but "AC Milan" just sounded wrong to me.

                When Baggio joined "Juventus," my fate was sealed. Furthermore, Juventus means "youth" in latin so it
                adds to an attraction to a young boy (back then) like me.</i></ul>
            <h4><li>It makes us dream</li></h4>
        <ul><i>A scrawny 20-year-old forward played in Roberto Baggio's place and he completed that comeback in the 87th minute in the Juventus vs Fiorentina game in the 1994-95 season:</i></ul>    
        <iframe width="350" height="215" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iJxK1LodYyk?si=6w47y9JHkPnGGRQm" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <ul><i>Juve have scored many wonderful goals, but until today, that is still the best Juve goal I've ever seen live.

            For me, it's Baggio. Back in the 1980s, it's Michel Platini. For many, it's Alessandro Del Piero. They make us dream.</i></ul>
