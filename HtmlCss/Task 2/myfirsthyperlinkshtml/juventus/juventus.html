    <strong>The history of the Juventus fans</strong>
    <ul>
        <li><i>The first real groups of Juventus supporters came in the middle of the 1970's. The first two groups were
                on
                the extreme left side in politics and were badly organized. The first two groups were called Venceremos
                and
                Autonomia Bianconera. In 1976 the first two real ultras groups were founded, Fossa Dei Campioni and
                Panthers. One year later the historic group Fighters was founded by Beppe Rossi. He was the most
                important
                figure among the Juventus supporters and had extreme influence on young ultras in Turin.</i></li>

        <li><i>In 1987 the historic group Fighters was dissolved after 10 years of glory. The reason was the fighting
                and violence that occured in the away match against historic rivals Fiorentina. The majority of the old
                Fighters members, along with members from other groups (Indians and Gioventu Bianconera) decided to
                create a new group called Arancia Meccanica(Clockwork Orange). The name was inspired by the popular
                Stanley Kubrick film.</i></li>
