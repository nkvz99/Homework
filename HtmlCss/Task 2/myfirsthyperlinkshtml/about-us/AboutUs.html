    <h1> Juventus at a glance</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><i>Founded in 1897 and listed on the Italian stock market, Juventus is a professional football club which,
                thanks to its more than century–long history, has become one of the most representative and popular team
                at
                a national and international level.

                Juventus is the most successful Italian team and one of the most decorated in European football.

                In 1985 was the first ever club to win all the available international trophies. All club’s records have
                been achieved under the ownership of the Agnelli's family, a record itself as, with 96 and counting
                years,
                it is the longest active ownership of a professional sport entities in the world.

                Juventus can also count on an undisputed global reach with more than 100 million fans in Europe and more
                than 440 million followers worldwide including more than 99 million followers on various digital
                channels.

                The continuous improvement of the business allowed the company to be included in the Top 12 world
                football
                clubs for revenue in every edition of the Deloitte Football Money League since its inception, exceeding
                500M
                in total revenue and income in the past 3 years.

                Among the players that wore or that are currently wearing the iconic black and white striped jersey
                there
                are some of the greatest players of football history like the italians Boniperti, Baggio, Del Piero,
                Pirlo
                and Buffon and the international stars like Platini, Zidane, Nedved, Ibrahimovic, Pogba, Dybala and
                Cristiano Ronaldo.</i></li>

    <strong>The strength of an idea</strong>
    <ul>
        <li><i>It all began with a bench on Corso Re Umberto, one of the most famous streets in city centre Turin. A
                group of friends congregated on this bench. They all possessed a shared passion for football, a special
                game that had recently been ‘imported’ from England. They had an intriguing idea, to create a sports
                club. The boys attended the ‘Massimo D’Azeglio’ high school which specialised in classical studies. They
                were well educated but the eldest was just 17 years of age. This paved the way for the club’s name. In
                Latin, the name ‘Juventus’ means youth. They weren’t aware of it yet, but on 1 November 1897, they had
                given birth to a legend.</i></li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Tragic first European Cup.</strong>
    <ul>
        <li><i>Juventus became continental champions for the first time in 1985 by beating Liverpool 1-0 in a final
                better remembered for awful reasons. At the Heysel Stadium in Brussels, 39 supporters were killed in a
                human avalanche that caused a wall to collapse shortly before kick-off. The game went ahead despite the
                tragedy and Juventus won by a penalty converted by three-time Ballon d’Or winner Michel Platini.</i>
